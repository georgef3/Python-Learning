#7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
#looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines
#and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. 
#Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt 
#when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name

fname = raw_input('Enter file name: ') #requests input
if len(fname) == 0:
    fname = 'mbox-short.txt'
fh = open(fname) #opens the specified name

count=0 #sets the count at zero
total=0 #sets the total at zero
answer=0 #sets the answer at zero
for line in fh: #creates a for loop in 'fh'
    if not line.startswith('X-DSPAM-Confidence:') : 
        continue
    count = count + 1 #creates the denominator by counting each line
    number = float(line[line.find('0.'):]) #captures the numerator amount
    total = number + total #creates the numerator by addint the numerator amount each time
answer = total / count 
print "Average spam confidence:", answer
