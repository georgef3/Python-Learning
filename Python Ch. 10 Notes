#Python for Everyone Chapter 10, Tuples

#Lists, dictionaries, and finally tuples, which are like lists
use parenthesis instead of square brackets, but they are immutable
#like a string in that they can't be changed, they can't be sorted,
can't be appended

>>>1 = list()
>>>dir(1)
[append, count, extend, index,insert,pop,remove,reverse,sort] are things
that can be done to this list
>>>t = tuple()
>>>dir(t)
[count,index]

#tuples are much more efficient

>>>(x,y) = (4,'fred')
>>>print y
fred
>>>a,b = (99,98)
>>>print a
99

>>>d=dict()
>>>d['csev']=2
>>>d['cwen']=4
>>>for (k,v) in d.items():
>>>print k,v

>>>csev 2
>>>cwen 4
>>>tups=d.items()
>>>print tups
[('csev',2),('cwen',4)]
